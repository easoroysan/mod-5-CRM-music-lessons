digital ocean for deploying react rails project

mongo db university (free)

stuff to fix/change:
-use more thunk
-add user creation/editing
-going to a url of an instructor that does not exist throws error
-when setting time to inactive that has lessons in it, will still show lessons when you first check the inactive lessons (as though the lessons are still active)
-find good way to clear forms after submission
-display times in a better way
